===================================================================

##Description
This is a C sapmle for working with the MAX7219 display driver to control 8 LED 8x8 matrixes. It is intended to be used with the Tinusaur board but should also work with any other board based on ATtiny85 or similar microcontroller.

##Supported microcontrollers
This was developed with and tested on the following microcontrollers: ATtiny85

##Requirements
This example is written in plain C and require only additional libraries:
- Tinusaur MAX7219 Library for LED 8x8 Matrix
- WinAVR SDK.
